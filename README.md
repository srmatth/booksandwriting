Semantic Text Profiling refers to the similarity of a text to a
particular concept or idea over the span of that text. For instance,

## Basic App Usage

## How it Works

## Acknowledgments and Additional Resources

-   Built-in available texts are taken from [Project
    Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Visit their website to learn
    more.
-   Word Embedding model was pulled from the [NLPL Word Embeddings
    Repository](http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/).
-   The background photo in the app was taken by Engin Akyurt and
    obtained from [the Pexels
    Website](https://www.pexels.com/photo/assorted-books-on-wooden-shelf-2943603/)
    on 1 April 2022.
-   The kernel smoother used in the semantic profile plots is from the
    package `{FKSUM}` created by David Hofmeyr, more information about
    the implementation can be found [in the published
    paper](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v101.i03).
